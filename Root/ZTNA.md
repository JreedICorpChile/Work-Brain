Zero Trust Network Access is a network security concept which works on the principle of least access which is also included in [[Prisma SASE | Palo Alto's Offerings]]. 

# ZTNA 1.0 

This early implementation of ZTNA was a good idea at the time and was designed to more securely allow access to users using VPNs outside the enterprise to connect to data centers and services. 

Unfortunately this method falls short due to:

- Lack of traffic inspection
- Lack of continuous verification
- Failing the principle of least Privilege Access
- Doesn't protect all data
- Doesn't protect all apps

# This is where..

# ZTNA 2.0

## Comes in..

#### The most prominent features include:

- Least Privilege Access
	- ZTNA 2.0 applies the principles of **least privilege access**, where a user is provided the least required access to an application to minimize the attack surface.

- Continuous Trust Verification
	- ZTNA 2.0 delivers **continuous trust verification** in case of changes in user behavior, application behavior, or device posture.

- Continuous Security Inspection
	- ZTNA 2.0 delivers **continuous security inspection** for all traffic to protect against all threats and threat vectors.

- Protection for All Data
	- - ZTNA 2.0 **protects all data** in a consistent manner.

- Protections for All Apps
	- ZTNA 2.0 **protects and secures all applications** across the enterprise, including collaboration applications not typically protected by ZTNA 1.0 solutions.

### [[Prisma Access]] protects today's hybrid workforce with the superior security capabilities of ZTNA 2.0 while providing exceptional user experiences from a simple, unified security product. 


### Prisma Access enables customers to fully realize the principle of least-privilege access by identifying applications based on App-IDs at Layer 7. Once access to an application is granted, Prisma Access continually assesses trust based on changes in device posture, user behavior, and application behavior. Also provides deep and ongoing inspection of all traffic, even for allowed connections to prevent all threats, including zero-day threats. Prisma Access delivers consistent data protection across all applications used in the enterprise, including private applications and SaaS, with a single DLP policy. Prisma Access consistently secures all applications used across the enterprise, including modern cloud native apps, legacy private apps, and SaaS apps.
