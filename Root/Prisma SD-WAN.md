This is the network portion of the [[Prisma SASE]] offering, including things like bandwidth, stability and overall connection quality. 


- A next generation SD-WAN solution, overcoming legacy SD-WAN solutions by using app defined intelligence to create SD-WAN policies and engineer network traffic. 

- The autonomous nature of Prisma SD-WAN uses ML for data science methodologies to eliminate the labor intensive work that previously was required to run a network. 

- This is a cloud delivered solution that can easily configure interconnections, establish network service levels and gather stats for analysis. 

- Prisma SD-WAN cloud management service provides a simplified wat to connect locations. 

- Policies are defined by the apps that pass the network which allows decisions for path selection and network optimization in real time. 

- Prisma SD-WANs instant-On (ION) appliances establish the SD-WAN fabric across data centers and branch offices. 

- The appliances connect underlying network transports and keep in constant communication with Prisma SD-WAN cloud service. 

- Prisma SD-WANs [[CloudBlades]] enable API-based connectivity between ION appliances and cloud-based infrastructure services. 

- CloudBlades provides a centralized approach to program PSW (Prisma SD-WAN) devices for the integration of application flows with best-of-breed cloud services without complexity. 

- PSW offers orgs tremendous value over the alternatives.

- [[SASE Clients]] have experienced the ability to increase their WAN bandwidth significantly by leveraging scalable internet connectivity. 

- Because such improvement, customers have witnessed dramatic reductions in the number of help desk tickers due to WAN issues. 

- They have also seen lower costs associated with WAN management through the elimination of proprietary hardware, expensive dedicated connectivity and additional systems. 

- PSW is part of a larger Palo Alto Networks approach to solve the challenges of hybrid workforces, cloud and digital initiatives and branch office transformation. 

- All of the above is what's known as [[Prisma SASE]].

- Prisma SASE combines [[Prisma Access]], [[Prisma SD-WAN]], and [[ADEM]] to provide customers best-of-breed security, autonomous networking and an enhanced user experience - all delivered from the cloud.

# Prisma SD-WAN Details

- **Three Main Characteristics**
	- Application defined
	- Autonomous in Nature
	- Cloud Delivered 

- Prisma SD-WAN looks at the actual applications traversing the network. 

- If you can analyze which applications are more critical, you can provision and more easily support those applications. 

- Uses AI/ML for event correlation and automated problem remediation.

- Cloud native, less hassle and less costly.

- ION appliances are the backbone to how the SD-WAN is delivered to customers, it is meant to be a gateway to the SD-WAN connection.

- There are 3 components to how PSW works.
	- The Cloud Management portal
		- Policies Defined by apps
		- Intelligent path selection

	- Instant-ON ([[ION]]) Appliances
		- Connectivity for data centers/BO
		- Captures data for performance visibility

	- [[CloudBlades]]
