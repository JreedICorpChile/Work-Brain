Zero Trust Network Access is a network security concept which works on the principle of least access which is also included in [[Prisma SASE | Palo Alto's Offerings]]. 

# <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">ZTNA 1.0 </mark>

This early implementation of ZTNA was a good idea at the time and was designed to more securely allow access to users using VPNs outside the enterprise to connect to data centers and services. 

Unfortunately this method falls short due to:

- Lack of traffic inspection
- Lack of continuous verification
- Failing the principle of least Privilege Access
- Doesn't protect all data
- Doesn't protect all apps

- <mark style="background: #F038FF;">Continuous Trust Verification</mark>
	- ZTNA 2.0 delivers **continuous trust verification** in case of changes in user behavior, application behavior, or device posture.

- <mark style="background: #FB3640;">Continuous Security Inspection</mark>
	- ZTNA 2.0 delivers **continuous security inspection** for all traffic to protect against all threats and threat vectors.

- <mark style="background: #DDD92A;">Protection for All Data</mark>
	- - ZTNA 2.0 **protects all data** in a consistent manner.

- <mark style="background: #EA2B1F;">Protections for All Apps</mark>
	- ZTNA 2.0 **protects and secures all applications** across the enterprise, including collaboration applications not typically protected by ZTNA 1.0 solutions.

## [[Prisma Access]] protects today's hybrid workforce with the superior security capabilities of ZTNA 2.0 while providing exceptional user experiences from a simple, unified security product. 


### Prisma Access enables customers to fully realize the principle of least-privilege access by identifying applications based on App-IDs at Layer 7. Once access to an application is granted, Prisma Access continually assesses trust based on changes in device posture, user behavior, and application behavior. Also provides deep and ongoing inspection of all traffic, even for allowed connections to prevent all threats, including zero-day threats. Prisma Access delivers consistent data protection across all applications used in the enterprise, including private applications and SaaS, with a single DLP policy. Prisma Access consistently secures all applications used across the enterprise, including modern cloud native apps, legacy private apps, and SaaS apps.

# Leveraging Customer Use Cases

## Focus Points: 

### <mark style="background: #DDD92A;">Why Change?</mark> 

- You want to understand where **existing customer security solutions fall short** today. How does this **impact risk** to the customer's business and what do they want to **measurably improve**?

### <mark style="background: #C2E812;">Why Now?</mark>

- Are there are **strategic objectives or business drivers** such as an acquisition or cloud transformation that are driving the need for change now? 

- What is the **decision timeline**, who is making purchase decisions, and **what competitors** are involved?



### <mark style="background: #40F99B;">Why Palo Alto Networks? </mark>

- This is the opportunity to illustrate how **Prisma Access** uniquely resolves the customer issues as a **ZTNA 2.0 platform** and is differentiated from **competitors point products**.



# <mark style="background: #26F0F1;">- Specific Use Cases -</mark>

## VPN Replacement/ZTNA Project

This use case focuses on moving away from on-premises VPN concentrators and poor performing backhauling architectures, inefficient network paths, and expensive to manage infrastructure.


#### What should we as the seller be asking? 

- Where does your current VPN implementation fall short?

	- **Why ask:** Are there scalability & performance issues that can be addressed? What are the customers **key applications and where do they reside**?  Do internal applications contain sensitive **data that needs to be protected**?

- How do you measure user acceptance & success and performance metrics?
