### "Are you connecting and securing mobile users, branches, or both?"

- Prisma Access is priced per user per year. Users can be “mobile users” or “bandwidth required” in the branch.

	-  **Mobile User:** A mobile user is any user accessing application from anywhere at anytime. 

	- **Branch:** One license provides 1 Mbps for branch.  
      
	- **Mobile User & Branch:** When a customer purchases one license of this bundle they get both one user license and 1 Mbps bandwidth for branch.
